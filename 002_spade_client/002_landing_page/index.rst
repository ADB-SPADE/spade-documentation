After logging in, the SPADE landing page opens. Using this page, a user can navigate to maps for the city of interest.

1.	Clicking on the marker of a city, opens the SPADE map viewer with the featured map for a city. This featured map is to be curated by a SPADE administrator.
2.	When cities are located close to each other, a cluster is shown, indicating the number of clustered cities. Clicking on a cluster marker makes to map zoom in to the cities that form the cluster:

6.	The button the top of the sidebar will open the SPADE city search. This tool can be used to search a city by name. Clicking on the name of a city will open its featured map (same as clicking the marker on the map). The search bar can be used to find a city in the list of cities.
