SPADE Map viewer
============================
SPADE is available under the url: https://adb-spade.org

SPADE can be used with all major web browsers, however it is strongly recommended to use a recent version of either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

.. note::
  * After changing the opacity sliders in the Swipe & Compare tool and the Slide through time tool, the corresponding layer is not refreshed. Work-around is to change the layer to another layer, then change back to the layer desired.
  * The swiper bar of the Swipe & Compare tool, cannot be moved in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Work-around is to drag the underlying map to the left or to the right.
