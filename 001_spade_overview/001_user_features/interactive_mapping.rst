Interactive Mapping
===================

SPADE allows users to create and share interactive web maps. SPADE comes with helpful cartography tools for styling and composing maps graphically. These tools make it easy for anyone to assemble a web-based mapping application with functionality traditionally found in desktop GIS applications. Users can gain enhanced interactivity with GIS-specific tools such as querying and measuring.

Features include:

* GeoExplorer GIS client by default / Several pluggable clients available (Leaflet, REACT, ...)
* Graphical style editor
* Create multi-layer interactive maps
* Share and embed maps in web pages

SPADE Map Viewer
-------------------

A custom map viewer has been created for SPADE to find maps and layers for a city and perform simple but powerful analyses. The following tools allow to perform analyses:

 * :ref:`spade_landing_page` as an entry point to quickly find maps and layers for a city.
 * :ref:`spade_map_viewer` with tools to perform analyses:
      * :ref:`swipe_and_compare`
      * :ref:`slide_through_time`
      * :ref:`spade_drawing_toolbar`
      * :ref:`charts`
