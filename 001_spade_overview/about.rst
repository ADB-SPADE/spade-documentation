(ADB) established the Spatial Data Analysis Explorer (SPADE). It is a web-based information system that is both a repository of spatial and socioeconomic data relevant for sustainable and resilient infrastructure development and a tool to visualize, analyse, query and map the impacts of climate change induced severe weather events such as flooding from intense rain and storm surges from tropical cyclones. SPADE is available under the url: https://adb-spade.org

The development of the ADB-SPADE is in support to ADBâ€™s Livable cities vision and approach to urban development. Five (5) solution pathways have been identified and are grouped into water, nature, equity, resilience and digital. The ADB-SPADE is considered part of the digital group.
