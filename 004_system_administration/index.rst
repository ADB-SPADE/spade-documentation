:ref:`admin_panel`
  GeoNode has an administration panel based on the Django admin which can be used to do some database operations. Although most of the operations can and should be done through the normal GeoNode interface, the admin panel provides a quick overview and management tool over the database.

:ref:`admin_panel_spade`
  Some of the objects specific for SPADE (cities, charts, time-enabled rasters, swipable layers & clippable layers) are currently administered using the administration panel.

:ref:`system_architecture`
  Describes SPADE specific aspects of the system architecture and how the machines can be accessed for system administration tasks.

:ref:`data`
    This module will walk you through the various options available to load data into your GeoNode from GeoServer, on the command-line or programatically. You can choose from among these techniques depending on what kind of data you have and how you have your GeoNode setup.

:ref:`more_on_security_and_permissions`
    This tutorial will guide you through the steps that can be done in order to restrict the access on your data uploaded to GeoNode.
